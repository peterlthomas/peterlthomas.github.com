About me
-------- 

Welcome to my infrequently updated corner of the web!

I'm originally from Kenilworth, Warwickshire but I spent the 
last seven or so years in Nottingham. I've recently moved to
St. Albans, where I'm working for [Ocado](http://www.ocado.com).

Before that, I spent the last few years working on 
my PhD as a member of the [Document Engineering Lab](http://www.eprg.org) 
at the University of Nottingham. During my research, I spent some time
working for my sponsor, [Adobe Systems](http://www.adobe.com)
in San Jose, CA. Unfortunately for you, this means that if you have Acrobat 
installed, you probably have my code on your machine (my claim to fame!).
Finally &#151; my thesis described and implemented a novel application of 
markup-languages to final form documents, via heuristic layout and content 
recognition	techniques (phew).

I'm a pretty keen mountain biker. Personal favourites have got to be 
the trips to the French/Swiss Alps, swoopy Californian singletrack in Santa Cruz, 
the BUSA champs and, of course, the summer 24-hour races. Check out the 
[NUBike](http://www.nubike.com) website to find out
more about mountain biking at Nottingham Uni.
