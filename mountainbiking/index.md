I've been mountain biking since I was about 16, 
but I started taking it a bit more seriously since 
I joined 
[Nottingham Uni Cycling Club](http://www.nubike.com)
([NUBike](http://www.nubike.com)) a couple of years 
ago. Since then, I've been out to the Alps a few times, taken part in 
several 24 hour races and four BUSA championships (cross country 
and downhill).
